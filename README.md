# Number Guessing Game (Java Console Project)

## 1. Project Overview
This is a simple Java console game in which the computer randomly selects a number and the player has to guess it. 
After every guess, the program tells the player whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

This project is meant for beginners who are learning basic Java concepts like variables, loops, conditions, and user input.

## 2. Features
- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- User input using the keyboard
- Hints after every guess:
  - Too high
  - Too low
  - Correct
- Shows the total number of attempts taken
- Option to play again after finishing one round

## 3. Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Java
- JDK Version: 17 or above (works with most latest JDK versions)
- Tools (optional): VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA / Notepad + Command Prompt

## 4. How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Compile the program
Open terminal or command prompt in the folder where the file is saved and run:
```bash
javac NumberGuessGame.java
```

### Step 2: Run the program
After successful compilation, run:
```bash
java NumberGuessGame
```

### Step 3: How to Play
1. The game will choose a random number between 1 and 100.
2. Type your guess and press Enter.
3. The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
4. Keep guessing until you get the correct number.
5. At the end, the game will show how many attempts you took.
6. You can choose to play again or exit.

## 5. Concepts Used in Java
- `Scanner` class for user input
- `Random` class for generating random numbers
- `if-else` conditions for comparison
- `while` and `do-while` loops
- Basic input validation

## 6. Possible Improvements
- Add difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Limit the number of attempts
- Show a score based on attempts
- Add a main menu with options
