# Number-Guess-Game
This project is a simple Java console-based Number Guessing Game. The program randomly chooses a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. After every guess, the program gives a hint whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It also counts the total number of attempts and allows the user to play multiple rounds.
